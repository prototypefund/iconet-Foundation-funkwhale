# Create a channel

```{warning}
Your channel's __Fediverse handle__ needs to be unique. This is how other {term}`Fediverse` software identifies your channel. You can't change the __Fediverse handle__ once you've created your channel.
```

Create a channel to start publishing your content on your {term}`Funkwhale pod <Pod>`. Users can access channel content from Funkwhale or other Fediverse software.
