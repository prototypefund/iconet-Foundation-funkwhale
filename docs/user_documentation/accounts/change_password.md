# Change your password

```{warning}
Changing your account password also changes your Subsonic API password. If you are using a Subsonic app, you need to update your password in the app as well.
```

You can update your account password whenever you need to. To do this:

```{tabbed} Desktop

1. Log in to your account.
2. Select the cog icon ({fa}`cog`) or your avatar to expand the user menu.
3. Select {guilabel}`Settings`.
4. Scroll to the {guilabel}`Change my password` section.
5. Enter your {guilabel}`Current password`.
6. Enter your {guilabel}`New password`.
7. Select {guilabel}`Change password`.

```

```{tabbed} Mobile

1. Log in to your account.
2. Select the cog icon ({fa}`cog`) or your avatar to open the {guilabel}`Options` menu.
3. Select {guilabel}`Settings`.
4. Scroll to the {guilabel}`Change my password` section.
5. Enter your {guilabel}`Current password`.
6. Enter your {guilabel}`New password`.
7. Select {guilabel}`Change password`.

```

That's it! Your password is reset. You need to use your new password to log in from now on.
