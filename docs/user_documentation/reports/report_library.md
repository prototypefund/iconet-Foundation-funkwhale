# Report a library

If a channel's content violates a {term}`pod's <Pod>` rules or the law, you can report it. To do this:

1. Go to the library's details page.
2. Select the kebab menu ({fa}`ellipsis-v`) to open the options menu.
3. Select {guilabel}`Report this library`. A {guilabel}`Do you want to report this object?` menu appears.
4. Select a {guilabel}`Category`. Choose one of the following:
   - __Takedown request__ – request removal of copyrighted material.
   - __Illegal content__ –  report a library that features illegal content.
   - __Offensive content__ – report a library that features offensive or abusive content.
   - __Invalid metadata__ – report that a library's content features invalid metadata.
   - __Other__ – submit details of your report in the {guilabel}`Message` field.
5. __If you are not logged in__ – enter your {guilabel}`Email`. Pod moderators use this address to contact you.
6. Enter details of your report in the {guilabel}`Message` field. Provide as much detail as possible here to help the moderators action the report.
7. Select {guilabel}`Submit report` to send your report to the pod moderators.

That's it! The pod's moderators can now action the report or contact you for clarification.
