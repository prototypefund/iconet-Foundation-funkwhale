# Create a library

```{tip}
Want to publish your own content on your {term}`pod`? Take a look at [channels](../channels/index).
```

To start uploading your collection to your pod, you need to create a library. You can create as many libraries as you need.

To create a library:

```{tabbed} Desktop

1. Log in to your pod.
2. Select the upload icon ({fa}`upload`) in the top of the sidebar.
3. Select {guilabel}`Get started` under {guilabel}`Upload third-party content in a library`.
4. A screen appears showing your upload quota. If you have created any libraries, these are also shown.
5. Select {guilabel}`Create a new library`.
6. Enter a {guilabel}`Name` for your library (required).
7. Enter {guilabel}`Description` for your library.
8. Set the {guilabel}`Visibility` of your library. This determines who can access the content.
   - {guilabel}`Everyone, across all instances` – the library's content is available to everybody who interacts with your pod. This includes users of other pods.
   - {guilabel}`Everyone on this instance` – the library's content is available to all users on your pod. This does not include users of other pods.
   - {guilabel}`Nobody except me` – the library's content is only available to you and people you share the library with.
9. Select {guilabel}`Create library`.
10. A screen appears showing you a summary of your library.

```
