# Upgrade your Debian Funkwhale installation

If you installed Funkwhale following the [Debian guide](../installation_docs/debian.md), follow these steps to upgrade.

## Cleanup old funkwhale files

1. Stop the Funkwhale services.

   ```{code-block} sh
   sudo systemctl stop funkwhale.target
   ```

2. Navigate to your Funkwhale directory.

   ```{code-block} sh
   cd /srv/funkwhale
   ```

3. Remove the old files.

   ```{code-block} sh
   sudo rm -Rf api/* front/* venv
   ```

## Download Funkwhale

1. Export the Funkwhale version you want to update to. You'll use this in the rest of the commands in this guide.

   ```{parsed-literal}
   export FUNKWHALE_VERSION={sub-ref}`version`
   ```

2. Follow the [3. Download Funkwhale](../installation_docs/debian.md#3-download-funkwhale) installation section.

3. Follow the [4. Install the Funkwhale API](../installation_docs/debian.md#4-install-the-funkwhale-api) installation section.

## Update your Funkwhale instance

Once you have downloaded the new files, you can update your Funkwhale instance. To do this:

1. Install or upgrade all OS dependencies using the dependencies script.

   ```{code-block} sh
   sudo api/install_os_dependencies.sh install
   ```

2. Collect the new static files to serve.

   ```{code-block} sh
   sudo venv/bin/funkwhale-manage collectstatic --no-input
   ```

3. Apply new database migrations.

   ```{code-block} sh
   sudo -u funkwhale venv/bin/funkwhale-manage migrate
   ```

4. Restart the Funkwhale services.

   ```{code-block} sh
   sudo systemctl start funkwhale.target
   ```

That's it! You've updated your Funkwhale pod. You should now see the new version running in your web browser.
