# Upgrade your Docker Funkwhale installation

If you installed Funkwhale following the [Docker guide](../installation_docs/docker.md), follow these steps to upgrade.

## Upgrade Funkwhale

1. SSH into your server
2. Log in as your `funkwhale` user.

   ```{code-block} sh
   su funkwhale
   ```

3. Navigate to your Funkwhale directory.

   ```{code-block} sh
   cd /srv/funkwhale
   ```

4. Export the Funkwhale version you want to update to. You'll use this in the rest of the commands in this guide.

   ```{parsed-literal}
   export FUNKWHALE_VERSION={sub-ref}`version`
   ```

5. Change the version number in your `.env` file. Update this to the same version number you exported in step 4.

   ```{code-block} sh
   nano .env
   ```

6. Load the configuration from your `.env` file.

   ```{code-block} sh
   source .env
   ```

7. Pull the updated containers.

   ```{code-block} sh
   docker-compose pull
   ```

8. Apply the database migrations.

   ```{code-block} sh
   docker-compose run --rm api python manage.py migrate
   ```

9. Relaunch your containers.

   ```{code-block} sh
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

That’s it! You’ve updated your Funkwhale pod. You should now see the new version running in your web browser.

## Upgrade the postgres container

Funkwhale depends on postgres for its database container. To upgrade postgres, you need to export your database and import it into the new container.

To upgrade postgres on Docker we use the [`postgres-upgrade`](https://hub.docker.com/r/tianon/postgres-upgrade/) container. This Docker container automates the process of upgrading between major versions of postgres. Use these commands to upgrade your postgres container:

1. Export your current postgres version number. You can find this in your `docker-compose.yml` file.

   ```{code-block} sh
   export OLD_POSTGRES=13
   ```

2. Export the major version number you want to upgrade to.

   ```{code-block} sh
   export NEW_POSTGRES=14
   ```

3. Stop the postgres container. This means no data changes while you are upgrading.

   ```{code-block} sh
   docker-compose stop postgres
   ```

4. Run the migration using the `postgres-upgrade` container. This creates a new version of the database in the `/srv/funkwhale/data/postgres-new` directory.

   ```{code-block} sh
   docker run --rm \
   -v $(pwd)/data/postgres:/var/lib/postgresql/${OLD_POSTGRES}/data \
   -v $(pwd)/data/postgres-new:/var/lib/postgresql/${NEW_POSTGRES}/data \
   tianon/postgres-upgrade:${OLD_POSTGRES}-to-${NEW_POSTGRES}
   ```

5. Re-add the access control rules required by Funkwhale.

   ```{code-block} sh
   echo "host all all all trust" | sudo tee -a ./data/postgres-new/pg_hba.conf
   ```

6. Swap your old database out with your new database.

   ```{code-block} sh
   mv ./data/postgres ./data/postgres-old
   mv ./data/postgres-new ./data/postgres
   ```

7. Pull the new postgres version.

   ```{code-block} sh
   docker-compose pull
   ```

8. Restart your containers.

   ```{code-block} sh
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

That's it! Your Funkwhale pod is now running the new version of postgres. The old database is available in `/srv/funkwhale/data/postgres-old`. You can back this up and remove it from your server once you've confirmed everything is working.
