## Install Funkwhale on your server

Funkwhale is self-hosted, meaning you run it on your own server. To set up your own Funkwhale pod, check out [our installation guides](installation_docs/index.md). Choose the installation method that works for you!

## Configure your Funkwhale pod

Once you've installed Funkwhale, you can use [the guides in this section](configuration_docs/index.md) to configure it.

## Upgrade your Funkwhale pod

Funkwhale releases new updates regularly. To keep up-to-date with these changes, check out our [upgrade guides](upgrade_docs/index.md). If you're moving from our deprecated mono-container Docker setup, check out our [migration guide](migration_guide/index.md).

## Manage your Funkwhale pod

Funkwhale provides tools for managing content and users on your Funkwhale pod. In addition to the [frontend moderation tools](../moderator_documentation/index.md), pod admins can use some extra tools for more powerful administration. Check out our [guide to the Django dashboard](django/index.md) and our [management script](manage_script/index.md) to get started.
