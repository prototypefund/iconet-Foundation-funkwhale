"Funkwhale includes a feature that mimics [Pleroma’s Message Rewrite "
"Facility (MRF)](https://docs-"
"develop.pleroma.social/backend/configuration/mrf/). The MRF enables "
"instance admins to create custom moderation rules. You can use these "
"rules to complement Funkwhale's [built-in moderation "
"tools](../../moderator_documentation/index.md)."
