msgid "Funkwhale uses Celery to handle asynchronous tasks. By default, Celery spawns a worker per CPU core. This can lead to higher memory usage."

#: ../../administrator_documentation/configuration_docs/optimize.md:9
msgid "You can set the number of workers using the `CELERYD_CONCURRENCY` variable in your `.env` file. For example, a value of `CELERYD_CONCURRENCY=1` spawns a single worker."

msgid "Reducing the number of celery workers slows down the handling of asynchronous tasks. On larger instances, this can cause performance problems."

msgid "Switch to solo pool execution"
msgstr ""

#: ../../administrator_documentation/configuration_docs/optimize.md:17
msgid "Celery uses a `prefork` pool by default. This enables the server to process many tasks at the same time. You can switch to a `solo` pool which handles tasks one at a time. This reduces memory overhead but removes the ability to process tasks concurrently."
